# What does this mean functionally

An engineer can get the Frequency Analysis chart and make a decision if the bridge is safe or not. 
Basically this means that the project can already do what the normal systems do, yet using just a conventional smartphone. We are just missing the machine learning function to make the decisions for a human, so any person can actually go on a walk, measure a bridge and know if it's safe or not :)
