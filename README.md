# Missing

- [done, we going online tonight baby] port it all, obviously
- we are ready to keep working normally now

# Next steps

- [DONE] First off, compile Python-3.9.5 on Debian 10. Looks like the latest supported version is 3.7. I regret not going for Arch Linux as my server OS, but people say it would be suicide. Now I am ranting while it compiles, on a README.md file :) Well, it is what it is I guess. Anyway, the weather is lovely today, isn't it?
- prep everything to allow a specially crafted .txt file to be used
- add a new button to allow the download of a crafted .txt file
- some sort of interpolation method, under research.
- investigate the MATLAB codes we got sent in the mail
- definitely make a more serious README
